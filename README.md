# Tabula Rasa Chess Engine

## Introduction

The Tabula Rasa Chess Engine is an ambitious open-source project aimed at developing a chess engine that learns and improves purely through self-play, without any initial strategic knowledge or data derived from human gameplay. By adhering to a strict "tabula rasa" approach, our AI will attempt to derive strategies and understand the complexities of chess from first principles.

## Vision

Our mission is to challenge the current AI landscape by engineering a chess engine that operates without any preconceived notions of the game. Through reinforcement learning and self-play, this project seeks to explore the depths of strategic understanding that an AI can achieve on its own.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A solid grasp of reinforcement learning algorithms and neural networks.
- Expertise in Python, given its extensive machine learning libraries.
- Familiarity with chess rules and standard notations.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/tabula-rasa-chess-engine.git

# Go into the repository
cd tabula-rasa-chess-engine

# Install dependencies
# (This section will be updated as the project evolves)
